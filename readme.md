- The countdown timer is updated every second, and the user can adjust the time using the buttons:
```
# Increase the timer by 10 seconds
duration += 10

# Decrease the timer by 10 seconds
duration = max(0, duration - 10)
```

## Sound Import
- The user can import `.mp3` or `.wav` files, which will play when the timer reaches a specified point:
```
selected_file = filedialog.askopenfilename(
    title="Select Sound File",
    filetypes=[("Audio Files", "*.mp3 *.wav")]
)
```
